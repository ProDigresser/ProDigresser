#### General Assembly Student on their Sortware Engineer Immersive program.

I am a highly experienced hospitality professional with a background in fine dining and speciality coffee, with experience in managing small teams to achieve daily goals. The stressful and fast paced environments of hospitality have ingrained in me an understanding of the need for clear communication, working together to achieve goals and organising priorities. The evolution of technology has always been one of my great wonders - including Programming and the Internet. My choice for a career change has been a long time coming, taking home web development courses years before enrolling in General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Course. I hope to bring all of these skills, new and old, to a developer team near you!
